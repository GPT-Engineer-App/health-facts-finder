# health-facts-finder

A web app that takes camera capture, finds and reads the ingredients of the product in the image using an existing backend (write a placeholder for the API call), it responds with the explanation for each of the ingredients.
- The first time the user clicks to capture photo, the app should ask for permissions: navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true}) to use the camera.
- Once permissions are granted, it should display the Video Stream.
- Using the  getUserMedia API it should capture the image with the ingredients.

- The ingredients are returned in risk order, from least beneficial for health to most benign.
